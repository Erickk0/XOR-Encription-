XOR Encryption

This project demonstrates a simple XOR encryption algorithm, created for learning purposes and to explore the basics of encryption techniques. XOR encryption is a symmetric key algorithm that uses the XOR bitwise operation to encrypt and decrypt data.
Features

    Basic encryption and decryption using the XOR operation
    Simple and easy-to-understand implementation

How It Works

The program applies the XOR operation between the data and a key, resulting in encrypted data. The same XOR operation can be used again to decrypt the data.
Purpose

This project was developed to learn and understand fundamental encryption techniques, with a focus on XOR encryption.
